# 🏗️ Stage 1: Build the application
FROM maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17 AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire project (assuming your Spring Boot app is in 'demo/')
COPY demo/ /app/

# Run Maven to build the project
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 🏃‍♂️ Stage 2: Run the application with a lightweight JDK
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre

# Set working directory for runtime container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose port 8080 (Spring Boot default port)
ENV PORT 10000
EXPOSE 10000

# Run the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
